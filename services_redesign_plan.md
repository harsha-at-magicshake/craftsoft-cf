# Services Page Redesign Plan

To align the Professional Services page with the modern look of the Courses page, I propose the following structure. This will ensure consistency and a premium feel across the entire website.

## 1. Filter Tabs
Add a dynamic filtering system similar to the courses page:
- **All Services** (Default)
- **Creative & Design**
- **Web & Cloud**
- **Career & Branding**

## 2. Redesigned Service Cards (`service-card-full`)
Each service will be represented by a full-width card with:
- **Left Column**: A large, vibrant icon with a gradient background matching the course categories (e.g., Red/Orange for Design, Purple for UI/UX, Teal for Development).
- **Center Column**: 
    - **Header**: Large, bold title.
    - **Description**: Clear explanation of value.
    - **Feature Tags**: Compact `service-meta` tags showcasing key deliverables (e.g., "ATS Friendly", "Responsive Design", "Custom CMS").
- **Right Column**: A prominent "Get Started" WhatsApp button that pre-fills with the specific service name.

## 3. Simplified Tech Stack
A cleaner, more visual grid for the technologies used in services (Figma, React, AWS, etc.).

## 4. Integrated Contact Form
The bottom contact form will be styled to match the home page's modern card look, featuring the new resilient sync logic.

### Approval Requested
I have the full HTML and CSS updates ready for this. Should I proceed with the implementation?
